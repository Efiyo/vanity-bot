# vanity-bot
My personal simple python bot that I made to learn the language

--------

Clone the repo with ```git clone https://github.com/Efiyo/vanity-bot.git```

Install requirements from requirements.txt via ```pip```

note that ```neofetch``` is also required for 1 command to function

Make a bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications

Enter your bot token into ```.env```

Run ```python bot.py```

Invite the bot to your server

--------

It currently has basic funcionality via Discord slash commands such as:

```/temp``` to check the temperature of the device

```/neofetch``` to show the current specs of the machine it's running on, currently only Linux supported

```/ping``` to show the current latency in ms of the bot

```/roll``` to just roll a dice from 1-100
